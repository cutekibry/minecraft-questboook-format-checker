At some point, you will need to place down a §lLOT§r of §9simulation chambers§r, and doing the filtering for all of these can get annoying really quickly.%n%nThis is why we recommend using the §aUber Conduit Probe§r, a wonderful tool that allows you to copy the settings of a conduit, and apply them to a group of conduits.%n%nFirst thing to do to use it is §6Shift+Scroll Wheel§r to select your mode (§agreen = copy§r, §dpurple = paste§r).%n%nOnce in §acopy mode§r, §6Right Click§r on the conduit you want to §acopy§r, and a message should appear in chat telling you it copied successfully.%n%nThen, switch to §dpaste mode§r, a §cred area§r should appear, this is the area in which the uber probe will §dpaste§r the settings. Now simply select the §cred area§r to be the size you need it too, §6Right Click§r to confirm and §lDone§r%nTo exit the selection, simply §6Right Click§r in the air.
